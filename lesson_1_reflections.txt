Diff quickly highlights all of the differences, even small ones that are hard to see.
It can go through many lines very quickly.

Having the complete history of a file shows how it evolved and changed over time.

The pros of manual commits is that you have a chance to decide on logical units
(not too big or too small)

The cons of manual commits, is that you might forget to do it (takes discipline).
There might be inconsistent use by different people on your team.

Git allows tracking accross multiple files becasue it is designed for code, and multiple related files are common

Google docs does not track accross multiple files, because the document is the logical unit: it's unlikelyh to make related cahanges in multiple docs.

Git log shows the messages for each commit (and some stats)
Git diff allows you to compare two committed files.

Using version control would make you more confident in making changes to your code because you can keep track of changes and always go back to a working version

I want to use git to keep track of my code and other documents and communicate with my team.
